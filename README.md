- 👋🏻 Hi, I’m Cecily!
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend web development.
- 🧠 I’m currently learning React.

I worked in the medical field for 10 years, but found a new passion in web development.
I love that it allows me to use my natural creativity to make things that are useful.
It is challenging and there is always something new to learn, but that is part of what I love about it!
